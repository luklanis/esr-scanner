<p>There are two possible solutions supported from ESR Scanner to use it and an online banking portal
directly on an Android device.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Copy over notification</strong><br/>
  	An notification appears in the notification area when closing the ESR Scanner.
  	This notification helps to simply switch between an Activity (ex. a Browser with
  	an opened online banking portal) and the ESR Scanner.
  	When the activity that needs the data from the ESR Scanner is open, tab the 
  	notification and the ESR Scanner will start. But instead of his normal behavior,
  	the ESR Scanner will close after a successful scan and return to the Activity opened
  	before. The needed result of the scan is copied to the clipboard.
  	Now you only need to paste the data in the correct text field.
  	
  	<p>To activate the notification, please enable "Copy scan result over notification" in the preferences.</p>
  </li>
  	
  <li><strong>ESR Scanner as input method (IME)</strong><br/>
  	The ESR Scanner adds him self to the list of input methods.
  	You need to enable and activate it in the system settings if you'd like to use
  	it. Instead of a display keyboard, the ESR Scanner appears if you tab on a
  	text field. After a successful scan, the ESR Scanner pastes the result to the actual
  	position of the cursor and disappears.
  	Unfortunately, the ESR Scanner IME works only in landscape.
  	
  	<p>For an easy switch back to a real display keyboard, hold the device in portrait
  	mode and use the button on the bottom.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
