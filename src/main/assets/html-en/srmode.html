<p>In this mode <strong>ESR Scanner</strong> works like a payment slip reader (ex. <a
        href="http://www.paypen.ch">paypen</a>).
    Simply scan your payment and the code row will be sent to your computer.</p>

<strong>How to use</strong>
<ol>
    <li>Download ESR Receiver (you need Java) from
        <a href="http://www.wuala.com/gulb/open/ESRReceiver">
            http://www.wuala.com/gulb/open/ESRReceiver</a></li>
    <li>Your</li>
    <li>Ensure that the computer, that runs the ESR Receiver, is directly connected to the
        smartphone over a network solution
        listed above.
    </li>
    <li>Start the ESR Receiver</li>
    <li>Press <img src="../images/ic_menu_edit.png" alt="Activate slip stream"/>
        to activate payment slip reader mode
    </li>
    <li>Fill in the showed (on the bottom right corner) ip address on ESR Receiver and press
        "Connect"
    </li>
    <li><strong>Or (since ESR Receiver version 0.6.1)</strong> Wait (max. 1 minute), until the ESR
        Receiver connects automatically
    </li>
    <li>Wait until ESR Receiver becomes connected state</li>
    <li>If "Auto paste" on the ESR Receiver is checked, just set the cursor to the location where
        the code row should be placed and scan the code.
    </li>
    <li>Otherwise scan the code and paste it with Ctrl-V or right-click-paste in the input field.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>If you have slip-reader mode activated, the code row wouldn't be saved on the phone.</p>

<p>If you'd like to send code rows from already scanned payments, deactivate slip-reader mode, open
    History
    and press <img src="../images/ic_menu_send.png" alt="Send code row"/>.</p>
